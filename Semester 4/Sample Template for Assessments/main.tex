\textit{The necessary changes to be executed, in order to transform this template to your assignment could be found within square brackets - [ ] or with the initiation of the word "Sample". The compact style of documentation is ideal to follow in an assignment where the page limit is defined and critical}.

\paragraph*{Problem 1} %\hfill \newline
Sample Question: A part of the code for a linear classifier for CIFAR10 given in listing 1. For our linear classifier, the score function is $f(x) = Wx + b$, and the loss function is the mean sum of squared errors function.
\newline
Sample Answer: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\cite{A1} (The citations could be added using cite package).

\textit{The mathematical equations could be included using math package as indicated here.} 
\begin{equation}
    f(x_i,W,b) = Wx_i + b
\end{equation}
\textit{Mathematical expressions could be added within the text passage as follows. Sample Text: Here, $x_i \in R^D$ each associated with a label $y_i$. Here $i=1...N$ and $y_i\in 1...K$ such that N examples, with dimensionality D, in accordance with K distinct categories.}

\paragraph*{Problem 4}
Sample Question: Construct a CNN using \textit{Keras.models.Sequential} (with the following configuration: C32, C64, C64, F64, F10. All three convolutions layers are 3x3. Max pooling (2x2) follows each convolution layer. Use SDG (with momentum) with a batch size of 50 and \textit{CategoricalCrossentropy} as the loss (Include how many learnable parameters are there in this network?, report the parameters such as the learning rate and momentum and Report training and testing loss and accuracies)
